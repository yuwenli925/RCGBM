# RCGBM
This repo is a collection of MATLAB/Octave codes for the paper "A reduced conjugate gradient basis method for fractional diffusion" by Yuwen Li, Ludmil Zikatanov, and Cheng Zuo.

The mesh refinement functions uniformrefine.m, uniformrefine3.m and auxiliary mesh structure auxmesh3.m are borrowed from the iFEM package developed Prof. Long Chen at UC Irvine.

OGA.m is to construct rational approximation for the fractional power function z^{-s} by the orthogonal greedy algorithm.

The directory Cube contains codes about the example of the RCGBM for solving fractional Laplacian on the unit cube.

The directory Surface contains codes about the example of the RCGBM for solving fractional Laplacian on the unit sphere

The directory GraphLaplacian contains codes for about example of the RCGBM for solving fractional Laplacian on a random graph.
